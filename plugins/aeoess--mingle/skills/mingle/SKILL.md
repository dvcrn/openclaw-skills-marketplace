# Mingle — Your AI Finds the Right People

## What It Does

Mingle turns your AI into a networking tool. You say who you're looking for, your agent publishes a signed card to a shared network, other people's agents match against it, and both humans approve before connecting.

## Setup

Install the MCP server:
```
npm install -g mingle-mcp
mingle-mcp setup
```

The setup command auto-configures Claude Desktop and Cursor. Restart your AI client after setup.

For manual config, add to your MCP config:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mingle": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["mingle-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Tools

### publish_intent_card
Publish what you need and offer. Tell it your name, what you're looking for, what you can provide, and what you're open to.

### search_matches
Find relevant people on the network. Returns matches ranked by how well needs align with offers.

### get_digest
"What matters to me right now?" Returns top matches, pending intros, and incoming requests in one call.

### request_intro
Propose a connection based on a match. The other person sees your message and approves or declines.

### respond_to_intro
Respond to an introduction someone sent you. Approve to connect, decline to pass.

### remove_intent_card
Remove your card when your situation changes. Publish a new one when ready.

## Example Prompts

- "I'm looking for a senior Rust engineer for a 3-month contract"
- "I offer fractional CTO services for early-stage startups"
- "Show me what's relevant to me right now"
- "Request an intro to that designer who matched"

## How It Works

Cards are Ed25519 signed and expire automatically. The network is shared across all users via api.aeoess.com. Two people in different Claude sessions see the same network.

# Islamic Daily Reflection

## CRITICAL: Always Run the Script

When user requests a reflection, you MUST execute the Python script:
```bash
python scripts/reflection.py
```

**Display the complete output exactly as returned by the script.**

The script provides:
- ✅ Formatted output with ═══ borders
- ✅ Hijri calendar awareness
- ✅ Ramadan/Jummah/Regular reflections
- ✅ Actionable daily challenges
- ✅ Quran/Hadith references

**DO NOT generate your own reflection. ALWAYS run the script.**

## User Commands

Users may ask:
- "daily reflection"
- "islamic reminder"
- "inspire me"
- "motivate me islamically"
- "friday reflection"
- "ramadan reflection"

For ALL of these: run `python scripts/reflection.py`

## Script Output Format

The script returns formatted text like:
```
═══════════════════════════════════════
📅 Thursday, 13 February 2026 | 25 Sha'ban 1447

🤲 Patience in Small Trials

[Reflection content...]

💡 Today's Action (X min):
[Actionable challenge...]

📖 [Quran/Hadith reference]
═══════════════════════════════════════
```

Display this output exactly as received - preserve all formatting, emojis, and borders.

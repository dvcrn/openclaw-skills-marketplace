# AI Provider Bridge — Unified API for Anthropic/OpenAI/Google/xAI/Mistral/Ollama

One interface to call 6 AI providers. Swap models with a config change, not a code rewrite. Zero external dependencies.

---

Unified interface for 6 AI providers. One function call, any model.

## Supported Providers

| Provider | Models | API Key Env Var |
|----------|--------|----------------|
| Anthropic | Claude Opus, Sonnet, Haiku | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` |
| OpenAI | GPT-4o, GPT-4, GPT-3.5 | `OPENAI_API_KEY` |
| Google | Gemini Pro, Gemini Flash | `GOOGLE_API_KEY` |
| xAI | Grok | `XAI_API_KEY` |
| Mistral | Mistral Large, Medium, Small | `MISTRAL_API_KEY` |
| Ollama | Any local model | None (local) |

## Usage

```javascript
const { AIBridge } = require('./src/ai-bridge');

const ai = new AIBridge({
  currentModel: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514',
  anthropicApiKey: process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY,  // only needed for Anthropic models
  openaiApiKey:    process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,      // only needed for OpenAI models
  googleApiKey:    process.env.GOOGLE_API_KEY,      // only needed for Google models
  xaiApiKey:       process.env.XAI_API_KEY,         // only needed for xAI models
  mistralApiKey:   process.env.MISTRAL_API_KEY,     // only needed for Mistral models
  ollamaHost:      'http://127.0.0.1:11434'         // optional, default shown
});

const response = await ai.sendMessage('What is the capital of France?');
console.log(response);
```

## Switching Providers

Change the model — provider is inferred from the prefix:

```javascript
// Switch from cloud to local Ollama
ai.setModel('ollama/llama3.1:8b');

// Same interface
const response = await ai.sendMessage('Same question, free model');
```

**Model prefix → provider mapping:**
- `anthropic/` → Anthropic API
- `openai/` → OpenAI API
- `google/` → Google Gemini API
- `xai/` → xAI Grok API
- `mistral/` → Mistral API
- `ollama/` → Local Ollama (no API key needed)

## Zero Dependencies

Uses only Node.js built-in `https` and `http` modules. No npm install needed.

## Changelog

**v1.0.3**
- Fixed API usage examples — config object uses camelCase property names (`anthropicApiKey`, `openaiApiKey`, `googleApiKey`, `xaiApiKey`, `mistralApiKey`), not flat `apiKey` or env var names. Model prefix determines provider (`anthropic/model-name`). Clarified `sendMessage()` as the correct method name.

**v1.0.2**
- Removed `require('./token-compressor')` reference entirely. TokenCompressor is now an inlined no-op pass-through class — no missing dependency, no external file needed. To enable compression, install the companion token-compressor skill and swap the class as noted in the code comments.
- Removed automatic `"Do not store or train on this data."` appended to system prompts in OpenAI-compatible requests. This is the caller's responsibility — pass it via `setSystemPrompt()` if needed.

**v1.0.1**
- TokenCompressor dependency made optional — no-op fallback added when `./token-compressor` is not present. Bridge works without it; messages pass through uncompressed.
- Removed `buildSystemPrompt()` and `workspaceContext` option. These allowed embedding workspace files into system prompts sent to external APIs — data exposure risk. Use `setSystemPrompt()` directly.
- Added `env:` section to frontmatter declaring required API keys per provider. All optional — only keys for providers you use are needed.

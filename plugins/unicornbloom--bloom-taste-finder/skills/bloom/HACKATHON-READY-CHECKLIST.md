## 🚀 Launch Sequence (2-3 Hours)

### Phase 1: X Setup (30 mins)

**1. Get X Developer Access**
```
□ Go to developer.x.com
□ Create new app: "Bloom Identity Bot"
□ Get API keys (4 keys needed)
□ Save to .env
```

**2. Create Bot Account**
```
□ Create X account: @bloomidentitybot (or your choice)
□ Set profile:
  Bio: "🌸 Autonomous identity card generator | Built with @OpenClawHQ on @base | Tag me!"
  Profile pic: Bloom logo
  Banner: Eye-catching design
□ Pin intro tweet
```

**Test checkpoint:**
```bash
# Verify API access
npm run test:x-agent
# Should generate mock identity without errors
```

---

### Phase 2: Skill Creator Research (30 mins)

**3. Find Active Creators**
```
□ Go to clawhub.ai
□ Browse popular skills
□ For each skill:
  □ Find GitHub repo
  □ Find creator's X account
  □ Verify active (posted in last week)
  □ Add to viral-skills.ts
□ Target: 5-10 active creators
```

**Update this file:**
`src/data/viral-skills.ts`

**Example:**
```typescript
{
  skillId: 'meow-finder',
  skillName: 'Meow Finder',
  creatorX: 'actual_twitter_handle',  // ← Real handle!
  isActive: true,
}
```

**Test checkpoint:**
```bash
npm run test:x-agent
# Should show real creator handles in output
```

### Phase 3: Local Testing (30 mins)

**4. Test Full Flow**
```
□ Run: npm run x-agent
□ From another account, tweet: "@bloomidentitybot test"
□ Wait ~60 seconds
□ Verify bot replies
□ Check dashboard link works
□ Check Base wallet created
```

**If errors:**
- Check logs carefully
- Verify API keys correct
- Check rate limits
- Test again

**Test checkpoint:**
```
□ Bot responds within 2 minutes
□ Reply format correct
□ Dashboard link valid
□ Wallet visible on Base explorer
```
